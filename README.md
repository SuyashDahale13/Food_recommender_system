## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`)
- Git

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone -b Version_1.1 https://github.com/SuyashDahale13/Food_Recommender_System.git
   cd Food_Recommender_System/Food
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
   # OR
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Setup the database (if applicable):**
   If your system uses a database, you can set it up as follows:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the development server:**
   Start the Django development server to run the application locally:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Access the app:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the Food Recommender System.

## Usage
1. **Sign Up / Log In**: Users can sign up or log in to their account to access personalized recommendations.
2. **Input Preferences**: Users can input their dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free).
3. **Get Recommendations**: Based on user preferences and history, the system will recommend food items.
4. **Explore Restaurants**: Users can explore restaurants or food outlets based on the recommended items.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Django (Python framework)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database**: SQLite (default for Django)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (or any ML library used for food recommendation)
